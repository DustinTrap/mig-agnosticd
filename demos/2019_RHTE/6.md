# 6.0 Migrate Robot Shop Application

In this lab we are going to migrate a ACME Corporation's Production Internet Store, the Robot Shop.  This store is has lots of traffic daily, and ACME is very concerned about minimizing any downtime/unavailability of the store. The Robot Shop is running on your 3.11 cluster, and ACME is very interested in many of the new features of the OpenShift 4.x platform, and wants to migrate.  

If we login to 3.11 cluster, we can see the app running:

```bash
$ oc get pods -n robot-shop
NAME                         READY   STATUS    RESTARTS   AGE

```

Let's get the route to the application, and bring up the webUI.

```bash
$  oc get route -n mssql-persistent
NAME              HOST/PORT                                                       PATH   SERVICES     PORT   TERMINATION   WILDCARD
mssql-app-route   mssql-app-route-mssql-persistent.apps.cd76.events.opentlc.com          db-app-svc   5000                 None
```
