# 5.0 Migrate MSSQL Application

Next, we are going to migrate a simple Product Inventory web-based application front-end, backed backed by Microsoft SQL Server.  This application has been pre-deployed on your 3.11 cluster in the mssql-persistent namespace, using a single PV backed by NFS for persistent storage.

In our source 3.11 cluster terminal, we can see the app running:

```
$ oc get pods -n mssql-persistent
NAME                                    READY   STATUS    RESTARTS   AGE
mssql-app-deployment-6ffb46c5d6-n5fvv   1/1     Running   0          41m
mssql-deployment-1-xq4p4                1/1     Running   0          41m
```

Let's get the route to the application, and bring up the webUI.

```
$  oc get route -n mssql-persistent
NAME              HOST/PORT                                                       PATH   SERVICES     PORT   TERMINATION   WILDCARD
mssql-app-route   mssql-app-route-mssql-persistent.apps.cd76.events.opentlc.com          db-app-svc   5000                 None
```

![MSSQL Product Catalog](./screenshots/lab5/mssql-product-catalog.png)

Let's go ahead and add a new product to the inventory.  Click on the +Add button and enter some data.

![MSSQL Add Product](./screenshots/lab5/mssql-add-product.png)

You can see the application is functioning and state is being saved in the DB.  

![MSSQL Added Product](./screenshots/lab5/mssql-added-product.png)

Let's also verify that the application is NOT installed on our 4.3 destination cluster. You can see that no pods are running; and in fact the mssql-persistent namespace does *not* exist.

```
$ oc get pods -n mssql-persistent
No resources found.
```

## 5.1 Using CAM

Let's go ahead and define our Migration Plan in the CAM UI.

### 5.1.1 Create a Migration Plan

![CAM Mig Plan 1](./screenshots/lab5/cam-mig-plan-1.png)

Fill out a plan name. Click Next.

![CAM Mig Plan 2](./screenshots/lab5/cam-mig-plan-2.png)

Select the source and target cluster, the replication repository, and the `mssql-persistent` namespace (which we want to migrate over). Click Next.

![CAM Mig Plan 3](./screenshots/lab5/cam-mig-plan-3.png)

Now we are displayed a list of persistent volumes associated with our
application workload. Select which type of action you would like to perform on the PV. For this example, let's select `copy`.  Click Next.

![CAM Mig Plan 4](./screenshots/lab5/cam-mig-plan-4.png)

Select the storage class for your PVs.  In this case we will be copying our data from NFS to AWS-EBS (`gp2:kubernetes.io/aws-ebs`).  Click Next.

![CAM Mig Plan 5](./screenshots/lab5/cam-mig-plan-5.png)

After validating the migration plan, you will see a `Ready` message and you can click `Close`.

### 5.1.2 Migrate the Application Workload

Now we can select `Migrate` or `Stage` on the application. Since we don't care about downtime for this example, let's select `Migrate`:

![CAM Mig Plan Added](./screenshots/lab5/cam-mig-plan-added.png)

Optionally choose to *not* terminate the application on the source cluster.
Leave it unchecked and select `Migrate`.

![CAM Quiesce](./screenshots/lab5/cam-quiesce.png)

The migration will progress with a progress bar showing each step in the process.

![CAM Progress Bar](./screenshots/lab5/cam-progress-bar.png)

Once done, you should see `Migration Succeeded` on the migration plan.

![CAM Migration Complete](./screenshots/lab5/cam-migration-complete.png)


## 5.2 Verify Migrated Application

In the destination 4.3 cluster terminal, let's execute the following commands:

```
$ oc get pods -n mssql-persistent
NAME                                    READY   STATUS      RESTARTS   AGE
mssql-app-deployment-7cc7954fd8-swlkx   1/1     Running     0          3m55s
mssql-deployment-1-deploy               0/1     Completed   0          3m58s
mssql-deployment-1-wllln                1/1     Running     0          3m55s
```

We see that the mssql-persistent application is running.

Let's check the storage:

```
$ oc get pvc -n mssql-persistent
NAME        STATUS   VOLUME                                     CAPACITY   ACCESS MODES   STORAGECLASS   AGE
mssql-pvc   Bound    pvc-c0e077ea-e1c7-4ba7-a48e-051de94296fa   10Gi       RWO            gp2            4m52s
```

We see that our 10GB volume has been moved and is now running in AWS EBS.

Lastly, let's grab the route and open up the WebUI in our browser, and verify that the product we added prior to migration still exists.

```
$ oc get routes -n mssql-persistent
NAME              HOST/PORT                                                    PATH   SERVICES            PORT    TERMINATION   WILDCARD
mssql-app-route   mssql-app-route-mssql-persistent.apps.034f.open.redhat.com   /      mssql-app-service   <all>                 None
```
