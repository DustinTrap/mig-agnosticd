# 6.0 Migrate Sock-Shop Application

ACME Corporation is in the process of upgrading the production environment of their online socks store from OCP 3 to OCP 4. The application consists of various micro-services, and uses a shared NFS cluster for storage.  ACME has already installed the 4.3 cluster, and you have been asked to migrate the Socks-Shop application from their 3.11 environment.

The application and all of it's resources are contained within the `sock-shop` namespace.

Rather than provide a step-by-step walkthrough as we have in the previous two labs, you'll be on your own for this round.

The high-level steps are as follows:

1. Launch the CAM WebUI.

2. Add a new Migration Plan.

3. Be sure to specify `Move` vs Copy for the Persistent Volume transfer option; as we will be swinging the PVs to the new cluster but leaving the NFS storage as is.

4. Execute a `Migration` of the Plan.

5. Verify the application is functioning on the destination cluster.
